<p class="section-description-first">Yes, we agree with you! There's lots of t-shirt businesses out there, and unfortunately some of them are very bad. From low quality clothes to shady websites, you have to be very careful when buying anime merchandise online. That's the main pain we're here to solve!</p>
<p class="section-description">We're very proud with what we achieved so far, and this is only the beginning! We can present ourselves as an environmental sustainable brand, made by retro anime fans that struggled to find quality clothes for affordable prices. We picked one of the best clothing factory in Portugal to make sure our t-shirts last long in your hands. We also selected the best printing technique to avoid that cheap plastic feel most cheap clothing have.</p>
<p class="section-description-last">These are our strong points:</p>
